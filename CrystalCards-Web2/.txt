  
Grey with white patches;
So the bad stuff first my sister broke her ankle as in a full on break this morning so were all a bit upset about that for her. Friends and family gathered round and made ourselves available if and when needed. 

So its been quite boring today, though i did do a bunch of programming even if i did end up rolling what i had done back as the branch of technology i was exploring well i lacked the basics of that branch to fit what i was looking at into my mind, almost as if i had started at to higher point. This is not  a total loss as those points will make sense once i have built up the neural blocks to understand them. 

Ive swapped out my keyboard for a clicky clacky one for a while till i get bored of it and swap it back, this ones a k70 blue cherry, so one of the most clicky you can get. 

Ive done a bunch of reading today and really eaten to much, i did get a short walk into the sea front and along a little way but my hips started killing me so came back. 

Well much love 
Kat

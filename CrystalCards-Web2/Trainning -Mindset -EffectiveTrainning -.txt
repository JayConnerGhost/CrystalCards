#Trainning #Mindset #EffectiveTrainning #Weights #5x5

It has been a interesting few weeks, even though the gyms are not open right now, i have some weights here. I have been trying to find the enthusiasm i used to have for training, but its like trying to grasp smoke.I find that the thoughts of doing a 5x5 session at 80% max, just makes me go cold, yet i miss weights. 

I think what it is, is that, i hate myself and additionally i am lazy - i need to get a grip on both these factors and start working out properly, and get in a fit st5ate to hit the gyms when they open.

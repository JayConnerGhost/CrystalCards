#DogWalkers #Coffee #pain
So It is with great sadness that i see another two sheep dead, and there deaths caused by a dog, in this case walked by a professional dog walker. But i want to say this there is good and bad in all trades and professions most dog walkers i meet do an awesome job and are very professional, yet you still get those that there not mind on job so to speak and worse they have far to many dogs, but both these points could be made about a lot of private owners who walk there own dogs also. Additionally farmers have a responsibility to either fence the land off or to add a sign at the entrance to the land stating there is live stock on their. 

I have been using a Aero-press [https://aeropress.com/] for quite a while now and today switched back to straight filter coffee, i immediately missed the strength of the near espresso output of the AP. It is short of a espresso machine the bee's knees i find. 

I have been in pain the last 2 days dispite a over 10 painkillers [to prescription levels] - my knees are just shocking it is like walking on sharp ice and then a soft tissue injury to my ankle keeps letting me down despite it being over 6 years old. But i refuse to let any of this stop me, i will continue to get up move around and no matter how much it hurts i will not stop.
